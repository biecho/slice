### Abstract Summary:

- Discusses reverse engineering Intel's last-level cache (LLC) to address challenges in predicting cache slice mappings due to complex addressing, enhancing the feasibility of cache attacks. (Slice per core)
- Introduces an automatic, generic method utilizing CPU hardware performance counters for precise cache slice mapping, validated across diverse Intel micro-architectures.

### Note on Cache Slices and SMT:

The reference to "one slice per core" in the context of Intel's last-level cache (LLC) pertains to the physical cores of a processor. 
Each physical core is associated with a specific slice of the LLC to optimize efficiency. 
Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT), or Hyper-Threading in Intel terms, allows a physical core to handle multiple threads 
but does not alter the cache architecture; logical cores (threads) share the physical core's cache slice. 
This architecture emphasizes that cache slice mapping considerations and related security implications 
are grounded in the physical core structure, regardless of the number of threads managed by SMT.

### Introduction Summary:

- **Cache Attacks in Modern Processors**: The introduction outlines the role of caches in modern x86 micro-architectures as shared elements across cores, making them prime targets for attacks that breach security measures like hypervisor isolation. Cache attacks exploit timing differences between cached and evicted memory accesses, and can be executed at all levels of cache (L1, L2, LLC), with the Last Level Cache (LLC) being of particular interest due to its shared nature across cores, allowing attacks even when attacker and victim are on different cores.

- **Challenges of Cache Attacks on LLC**: The document highlights the unique challenges in attacking the LLC, notably the use of complex addressing to map addresses to cache slices, which is undocumented and varies by processor. This complexity hinders precise targeting for attacks, although some strategies like using huge pages or evicting the entire LLC have been employed to circumvent these difficulties.

- **Evolution of Cache Attack Techniques**: Previous techniques for cache attacks are discussed, including those requiring shared memory and others that do not, like constructing eviction sets to exploit cache replacement policies. The introduction also touches on the limitations of existing methods, particularly against processors using complex addressing, and mentions incomplete efforts to reverse engineer this complex addressing, underscoring the need for a more comprehensive understanding to effectively bypass security mechanisms like kernel ASLR.

### Notes on Specific Attacks and Countermeasures:

- **Shared Memory Attacks**: Initially effective but countered by disabling memory sharing across VMs by cloud providers.
- **Non-Shared Memory Attacks**: Requires finding addresses that map to the same cache set, with complex addressing adding significant difficulty.
- **Manual Reverse Engineering Efforts**: Previous attempts to decode complex addressing were partial and limited by processor variation, indicating a gap in current understanding and methodology.

- **Motivation for Reversing Addressing Function**: Interest in reversing the complex addressing function has grown, especially in discussions on exploiting the rowhammer vulnerability, which involves causing bit flips in DRAM by repeatedly accessing specific memory locations. The paper notes the potential for new exploitation techniques that do not rely on the now-disabled `clflush` instruction.

- **Automated Reverse Engineering Approach**: The paper introduces a fully automatic method for reverse engineering the complex cache addressing, leveraging performance counters to measure access to cache slices. This approach results in a translation table for determining the cache slice for any given physical address, overcoming limitations of previous manual efforts.

- **Algorithm for Compact Function Finding**: While identifying a compact mapping function is generally NP-hard, the paper presents an efficient algorithm for processors with \(2^n\) cores, offering new insights into last-level cache behavior and improving upon previous research.

- **Practical Contributions and Validation**: The paper outlines its main contributions, including the development of a generic method for mapping physical addresses to cache slices, a compact function for processor models with \(2^n\) cores, validation across modern processors, and practical examples showing the benefits for cache attacks.
